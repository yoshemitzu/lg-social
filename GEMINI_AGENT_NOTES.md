## Issue: Persistent HTML Malformation in Jinja2 Template (`report_template.html`)

**Problem Description:**
Despite refactoring `make-html.py` to use Jinja2, the generated HTML still contains malformed tags and attributes (e.g., unclosed tags, incorrect quoting, concatenated attribute values). This is preventing client-side JavaScript libraries like List.js from functioning correctly.

**Observed Behavior:**
- Browser developer tools show malformed HTML structure within the `<thead>` and `<tbody>` sections.
- `data-sort` attributes in `<th>` elements and `class` attributes in `<td>` elements are incorrectly rendered.
- `<a>` tags are malformed.

**Root Cause (Hypothesis):**
While Jinja2 resolves Python f-string escaping issues, the Jinja2 template itself (`report_template.html`) contains errors in its HTML syntax or in how it's using Jinja2 filters/expressions to generate attributes. This leads to invalid HTML being produced, which then breaks client-side JavaScript parsing.

**Current Status:**
This issue is preventing the full functionality of the HTML report and is a blocker for further HTML improvements.

**Decision:**
Debugging this specific HTML malformation within the Jinja2 template is being deferred. It requires a very careful, line-by-line review of the template and its Jinja2 expressions to ensure valid HTML output. The focus will shift to other project priorities.

**Action Item for Agent:**
Do not attempt further debugging of this HTML malformation issue until explicitly instructed. Focus on other tasks on the roadmap.
