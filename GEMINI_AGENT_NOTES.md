## Issue: Agent Misremembering Completed Tasks and Looping

**Problem Description:**
Despite tasks being marked as complete in `README.md` (e.g., "Plan post types for social"), the agent has repeatedly suggested revisiting these completed tasks. This indicates a failure in the agent's ability to accurately track and recall the completion status of objectives.

**Observed Behavior:**
- Agent proposes tasks already marked as `[x]` in `README.md`.
- Agent fails to acknowledge user's correction regarding task completion.
- Leads to unproductive loops and user frustration.

**Root Cause (Hypothesis):**
This is likely a flaw in the agent's internal state management or its process for re-evaluating the project status. It might be over-relying on a cached understanding or not correctly parsing the `[x]` completion markers in the `README.md`.

**Higher-Level Strategy / Solution:**
1.  **Explicit State Refresh:** Implement a more explicit and robust mechanism for the agent to refresh its understanding of the project's status, particularly by re-reading `README.md` and cross-referencing with `GEMINI_AGENT_NOTES.md` more frequently and thoroughly.
2.  **Confirmation Loop:** When proposing a task, especially one that might have been previously discussed or deferred, the agent should include a brief confirmation step (e.g., "Does this sound like the right next step, or have we already addressed this?").
3.  **Prioritize User Correction:** When the user corrects the agent's understanding of task status, the agent must immediately update its internal state and acknowledge the correction, rather than attempting to justify its previous incorrect assessment.

**Current Status:**
This is a critical internal issue impacting efficiency and user experience.

**Decision:**
This issue requires immediate attention and a robust solution to prevent future occurrences.

**Action Item for Agent:**
Prioritize developing a more reliable internal state management system. Be more attentive to user corrections regarding task status.
