## Issue: Persistent `replace` tool failures leading to endless loops

**Problem Description:**
The `replace` tool requires an *exact* match for the `old_string` parameter, including all whitespace, indentation, and line endings. When attempting to modify complex code blocks, especially those involving multiple lines or where the exact context is difficult to predict or maintain across iterative changes, the `replace` tool frequently fails with "0 occurrences found." This leads to unproductive loops where the agent repeatedly tries the same (or slightly varied) `replace` operation without success, consuming turns and frustrating the user.

**Root Cause:**
The `replace` tool's strict matching is excellent for precise, small, and isolated changes. However, it becomes a significant impediment for larger refactorings, insertions of new code blocks, or modifications that span multiple lines where the surrounding context might subtly change between `read_file` and `replace` attempts, or where the `old_string` itself is a complex, multi-line snippet. The agent's current strategy for complex modifications relies too heavily on `replace` for scenarios it's not well-suited for.

**Higher-Level Strategy / Solution:**
For complex code modifications (e.g., adding new functions, refactoring large blocks, inserting imports that affect line numbers/context, or when `replace` has failed more than once on a given task), the agent should adopt the following workflow:

1.  **Read Entire File:** Use `read_file` to get the *entire* content of the target file into memory.
2.  **Modify In-Memory:** Perform all necessary code manipulations (insertions, deletions, replacements) on the string content in Python. This allows for flexible, programmatic changes without the strict matching constraints of the `replace` tool.
3.  **Write Back Entire File:** Use `write_file` to overwrite the original file with the fully modified content.

This approach ensures that the agent has full control over the file's content and can make comprehensive changes in a single, atomic operation, significantly reducing the likelihood of `replace` failures and endless loops. The `replace` tool should be reserved for truly simple, single-line, or highly localized changes where its precision is an advantage.

**Action Item for Agent:**
When encountering persistent `replace` failures or when a modification is inherently complex, immediately switch to the "read-modify-write" strategy. Document any new recurring issues in this file.
