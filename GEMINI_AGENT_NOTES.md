## Issue: `git rm --cached` Command Failure

**Problem Description:**
Attempts to untrack a file (`.env`) using `git rm --cached .env` have repeatedly failed when executed via `run_shell_command`. The command returns a successful exit code (0) but the file remains tracked according to `git status`.

**Observed Behavior:**
- `run_shell_command` output for `git rm --cached .env` shows `Exit Code: 0`.
- Subsequent `git status` still lists `.env` as a tracked, modified file.
- User's manual execution of `git rm --cached .env` is successful.

**Root Cause (Hypothesis):**
This is likely an interaction issue between `run_shell_command` and Git's internal state, or a subtle difference in the execution environment. It's possible that `run_shell_command` is not correctly propagating the necessary environment or context for Git to fully untrack the file, even though the command itself appears to execute without a direct error from Git.

**Current Status:**
This issue is preventing proper `.env` file exclusion from the repository.

**Decision:**
Debugging this specific `git rm --cached` issue is being deferred. For now, the user will need to manually untrack `.env` if it becomes tracked again. The focus will shift to other project priorities.

**Action Item for Agent:**
Do not attempt further programmatic `git rm --cached` operations until explicitly instructed. Revisit this issue with a focus on `run_shell_command`'s interaction with Git's internal state.
