The following files can be deleted once they are no longer in use:

- questions for prototype.md
- roadmap.md
- to-dos.md
- GEMINI_AGENT_NOTES.md (This file is for internal agent notes and can be deleted once the project is stable and no further debugging is needed.)

**Note:** The `input("Press Enter to exit...")` line in `scripts/make-html.py` and `scripts/launch-report.py` can be removed once debugging is complete and you are satisfied with the script's behavior.
