refactor: Centralize hashtag management and improve report performance

- Centralized hashtag management by moving the list of hashtags to config.json.
- Refactored scripts to read hashtags from config.json, removing the dependency on HashtagLinks.csv.
- Created a new script to generate HashtagLinks.csv on an ad hoc basis.
- Improved report performance by replacing list.js with a plain JavaScript implementation for sorting and filtering.
- Added a main.py script to generate and open the report.
