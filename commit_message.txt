- Deleted old HTML reports from the html/ directory.
- Created a new reports/ directory for generated HTML reports.
- Modified scripts/make-html.py to output reports to the new reports/ directory.
- Modified main.py to look for reports in the reports/ directory.
- Added reports/ to .gitignore to prevent committing generated reports.
